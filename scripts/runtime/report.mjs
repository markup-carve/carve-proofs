const text = `# Rust and PHP phase scaling

Recorded ${data.metadata.generatedAt}. Rust uses commit \`${pins.rs.commit}\`;
PHP uses \`${pins.php.commit}\`. The [raw batches](runtime-timings.json) retain
wall and CPU samples, memory observations, source pins and build hashes.

Each phase is measured independently. Render reuses a parsed tree; HTML uses
the default conversion API and can take its fast route. Do not add phase timings.
PHP uses a clean INI with JIT disabled, unlike the tracing-JIT throughput
benchmarks in carve-bench. These measurements do not establish a runtime ranking.

## Endpoints and observed growth

The exponent is a log-log fit of wall time against input bytes over the recorded
sizes. It describes these samples, not a proven complexity bound. Tiny timings,
GC and scheduling can distort the fit. Nested inputs verify the requested depth.
Pretty-printed nested HTML grows with indentation as well as node count. The
HTML size column records that output cost; superlinear growth against source
bytes alone does not prove avoidable renderer work.

The final column has different units by reader: Rust reports total requested
allocation KiB per call, including reallocations; PHP reports peak managed
growth KiB above its pre-call baseline. Neither is retained memory or RSS,
and the columns cannot be compared as allocation totals.

| Reader | Family | Phase | Size range | First / last wall ms | Last CPU ms | Observed exponent | Last HTML KiB | Last memory KiB |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

## Method

${data.metadata.method}

Host load was ${data.metadata.loadStart.join(', ')} at the start and
${data.metadata.loadEnd.join(', ')} at the end on ${data.metadata.logicalCpus}
logical CPUs. This is a local shared-host run. Compare candidate changes with
alternating baseline runs before making a speed claim.

Reproduce with \`npm run build:runtime\`, \`npm run bench:runtime\` and
\`npm run report:runtime\`. The [JavaScript comparison](comparison.md) and
[CPU and allocation profiles](current-costs.md) cover the separately pinned JS reader.
